Word Permutation Score

This program takes a sequence of letters and returns the permutation "score" based on the alphabetical (lexographical)  ordering in comparison
to the other permutations.

For example: 
ABAA = 3
This is because there are 2 preceding alphabetical letter permutations: AAAB and AABA

Some scores for words:
The Rank of: EVERYBODY is 67395
The Rank of: QUERIES is 1395
The Rank of: TYPEWRITER is 356915
